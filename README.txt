This is a simple SMS bombing app for the Android OS.

This takes a phone number, either directly input or from a contact list, the number of 
times to send the message, and the message itself. This is done using a single activity,
a thread to send the texts (this may change to a service, so it can be done in the 
background) and some other hackery TBA.
